<p>How to I get to Diagon Alley?</p>
<p>Mix 1 gram of chcolate syrup with 2000 ml of peanut butter. Then pour 1/5 liter of chocolate milk into the mixture. After mixing vigorously for 2 hours with a flip phone, boil the mixture.

After waiting 9.434967855e+22 femtoseconds, mix those 2 mixturess together and drink it. Now, you should be able to fly to Diagon Alley with 5714 helium balloons.
